# Welcome to my Portfolio. Hope you like it!
For the High Seas challenge, I gave myself a challenge to build a revamped portfolio site of myself from Scratch using HTML, CSS and JS
Here is Version 1.1 of the Website, where I incorporated a colour palette and theme which I prefer and added some information and a contact me form. Hope you like it!
